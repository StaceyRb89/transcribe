Home page
Scribes Alive offers you a personal, reliable and accurate audio transcription service, bespoke to you and your project. 

All our transcripts are produced by real people and never through AI. 
A human transcriber can produce an accurate transcript, working through all the nuances of the subject, decipher strong accents and distinguish multiple speakers, whilst taking the extra attention to detail needed for an accurate record of what is being said. A human transcriber will also take the extra time to research names, places and technical terminology to ensure complete accuracy.

** Our transcripts are exclusively crafted by human transcribers, ensuring precision in capturing subject nuances, deciphering strong accents, identifying multiple speakers, and dedicating extra effort to detail. They also research names, locations, and technical terminology to maintain complete accuracy in the transcripts. **

Our team has experience working in all industries and subject areas, with an excellent ear for a wide variety of national and international accents. Every one of us takes great pride in returning fully researched, proofread and accurate transcripts for our clients.

About us
Pam -
Having worked for Southampton University Library for over 11 years, my husband and I took the plunge, and decided to go and live the dream and move to Portugal to run a smallholding, and subsequently to France in later years.
At that point I started a career change into audio transcription and have never looked back! I love the combination of my transcription work and being out in connection with the land, animals and nature.
After more than ten years working with some amazing people, I decided the time had come to branch out into my own business. 
To carry on the ethos of an amazing woman I worked with, Val Turner, I hope to continue to the benefits and enjoyment of our work made possible for me and my colleagues in the form of Scribes Alive. For us to be able to work in a small, connected team in an increasingly disconnected world, earning a reasonable income, with the flexibility that is needed, deserved, and wanted when it comes to our home life and families.

The Basics
So you‚Äôre ready to get some audio transcribed, what do you need to consider?
There are a variety of transcript types available depending on your needs from the end product. The two most commonly used formats are:
Strict verbatim ‚Äì your audio will be typed word-for-word, including all filler words, ums and ahs, pauses, silences and laughter.
Intelligent verbatim ‚Äì your audio will still be typed word-for-word but ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù for improved readability, clarity and conciseness, whilst retaining a true reproduction of the audio. For example, the transcriber may remove the overuse of filler words such as, like and you know. This is the most common and popular choice.
Still not sure what you need, or maybe you need aspects of strict verbatim mixed with intelligent, no problem! Just drop us an email and we can discuss a format to suit your needs. ***

**frequently asked questions**

What audio can be transcribed?
Scribes Alive have years of experience transcribing a huge variety of audio including interviews, focus groups, podcasts, disciplinary hearings, speeches, dictation, meetings and roundtable discussions. If you have audio you need in the written word, we can do it!

What if my audio is not very good or a word cannot be understood?
Whilst our transcribers will always try to produce a complete transcript, sometimes occasional words cannot be understood, or a name or technical phrase cannot be confirmed with research. 
In this instance, we will add a timestamp to your transcript with either a best guess or an inaudible. It is important for accuracy that our transcribers do not guess or make up what they think they have heard, we will always come back to you for confirmation.

I have an AI generated transcript, can that be edited and proofed?
We are happy to discuss this with you. We will need to review the audio and transcript first and discuss your needs. More often than not, it is faster, easier and cheaper for our team to transcribe it from scratch.  

How do you share your files?
To keep your audios and transcripts secure we share everything with you and our staff using Dropbox. If you have another method you would like to use we would be happy to discuss that further with you. We can work with all file types, but if you are unsure, just ask us. On rare occasions a file conversion may be necessary.

******* give colour - very important*****Will my audio be secure?
As mentioned above, we do all our file sharing within Dropbox for security. In addition, all our transcriptionists sign NDAs, including a section on computer and file security. When your transcript is complete all audio and transcripts will be fully deleted from all systems. **********

How fast can I get my transcript?
We offer a variety of turnaround times and price structures. With our core team, and extended team for larger projects, we can meet quick turnarounds and projects of most sizes. 
As part of the work-life balance ethic in our team, we maintain, wherever possible, a working week structure that suits each team member. This works in our favor and yours for turnaround times, as between us we have a variety of times we can work and like to work. 
For return of your transcripts, turnaround times refer to Monday to Friday, 9am ‚Äì 5pm. However, if you have an urgent file, just contact us so we can plan out a timeframe to suit your needs.

How much will it cost and how do I pay?
Audio transcription is charged at price per audio minute. This price will vary depending on the turnaround time. Contact us for details of our pricing structure.
You will be invoiced upon completion of your project. Our preferred payment method is bank transfer, but we are happy to accommodate your organization‚Äôs finance structure. 

How will my transcript be returned?
You will be sent a link for Dropbox to download your transcript once complete. All transcripts are created in Microsoft Word unless another format is required. We have a basic template that suits most client‚Äôs needs, however we can create a template specific for your project or use one you provide. 

What next?
Get in touch with us to discuss your project! Once we know what you require we can create a quote, get your files uploaded, and have your transcripts back within your timeframe.
